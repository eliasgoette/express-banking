# express-banking

An introductory project into Express.js, simulating basic banking operations. 
This was created after an introduction to Express.js during data science class. 
While it mimics server actions, it doesn't perform real banking operations. 
It serves as a hands-on learning tool to understand the basics of Express.js.

The actual app is in BankingApp and includes an API for actions like creating or deleting a bank account as well as the frontend, which communicates to the API.
